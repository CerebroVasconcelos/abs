	* Corrected the default path to abs.conf in the README.
	* Simplified and consolidated two sections of code.

	* Mark backups as incomplete if failed, and don't use these when generating hardlinks for future backups.
	* Empty lines in the config are now permitted. Updated the config comments to reflect that.
	* If it doesn't halt execution, it's a warning. Make sure warnings do no more harm than skipping the current backup.
	* Allow comments and whitespace anywhere in the config. Additionally, merge a two-step process for config validation checking and backup execution which also reduces code duplication.
	* safetyChecks() renamed doSafetyChecks(). Includes comment and whitespace fixes.
